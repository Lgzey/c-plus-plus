Without naming specifics

1) Learn the winapi really fucking well

2) Some sort of hooking library

3) Some sort of drawing, maybe dx, maybe opengl

4) Some sort of gui lib

5) Some sort of scripting, python, maybe js, lua (barf), or get good at terminal stuff

Bonus points:

1) code emulation frameworks, i like unicorn

2) disassembler framework, i like capstone

3) assembler tooling, i use online stuff http://shell-storm.org/online/Online...-Disassembler/ and https://defuse.ca/online-x86-assembler.htm

This assumes C/C++ specifically for game hacking. There's a whole page i could list for general reverse engineering.

That should be enough for you to be proficient. Those are your categories to check box
